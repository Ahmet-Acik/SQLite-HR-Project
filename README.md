# SQLite HR Sample Database Project

This project provides a Python environment for exploring and querying the classic HR sample database using SQLite. It includes:
- A sample HR SQLite database file
- Example scripts for connecting, querying, and analyzing data
- Instructions for setup and usage

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- sqlite3 (included with Python standard library)
- pandas (for data analysis)

## Setup
1. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Run the example scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

## Project Structure
- `hr.db` — SQLite HR sample database file
- `scripts/` — Example Python scripts for database operations
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Getting Started
See `scripts/example_query.py` for a basic example of connecting to the database and running a query.

Replace the HR database file with your own if needed. For more advanced analysis, extend the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
